**Image Processor**

This was a project I worked on because I was curious how to manipulate the individual pixels of an image through code. I ended up discovering a couple things pretty quickly:

- Image brightness is easily manipulated through increasing or decreasing the RGB values of each image (This can also have a filter effect on the photo)
- Through randomizing all of the unique RGB color values in an image, photoshop edits of an image can be discovered rather easily
